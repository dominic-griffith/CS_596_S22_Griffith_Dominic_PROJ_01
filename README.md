# Project 1, Procedurally Generated Mesh (PGC)
Description: Create a procedurally generated mesh and use gitlab properly to deliver a functional prototype of a game.

 

Requirements:

 

Use Unity 2021.2.### and C#
Project name shall be CS_596_S22_LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME_PROJ_01   .  Deviations from the naming conventions will not be picked up by my grading script.
One main scene which procedurally generated mesh. Scene name = pgc_mesh_01 .
Your scene should have a main camera, a directional light and one additional game object named PGC_Controller with one script named PGC_Mesh.cs   . 
This script will generate a complete mesh with normals and an appropriate collider attached. 
The should have one unity primitive game object that drops onto your mesh when the scene is run. 
Your script should dynamically update the mesh in the Update function with a trigonometric function. An example will be shown in class.
A proper .gitignore file is required, a project without one will score a 0 on the assignment. See https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Unity.gitignore (Links to an external site.) for an example. 
Appropriate commits over time to show your progress are expected. Single or most at once commit history are contraindicated. 
Proper APA format documentation is required for all code. Include a bibliography.txt in your project. Note If you watch a video series to learn how to do this assignment, it is expected that you include that video series as part of your documentation.
